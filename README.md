## 📖 Abstract

This study introduces **TB-EnsembleX**, a novel ensemble-based transfer learning architecture for automated **tuberculosis detection** from chest X-ray images. The architecture integrates multiple pretrained CNNs including **VGG16**, **VGG19**, **InceptionV3**, and **Xception** to extract diverse and rich features. These features are concatenated into a unified feature vector.

To address class imbalance, **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** is applied during preprocessing. Then, **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is used to reduce feature dimensionality while retaining essential variance. A **Voting-based ensemble classifier** consisting of multiple Logistic Regression models is trained on the PCA-transformed space.

The model achieves an **impressive 99% accuracy**, showcasing its robustness and potential in **computer-aided TB screening**.

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Ensemble of four powerful pretrained CNNs (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception)  
✅ Transfer learning for improved feature generalization  
✅ SMOTE for class imbalance handling  
✅ PCA for dimensionality reduction  
✅ Voting classifier for reliable final predictions  
✅ Evaluation with comprehensive metrics and confusion matrix

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

We use combined chest X-ray datasets for binary classification:

- ✅ **TB Positive**
- ❌ **TB Negative (Normal)**

Sources:
- 🏥 Montgomery County X-ray Set
- 🏥 Shenzhen Hospital X-ray Set

All images are resized to 224×224, augmented, normalized, and preprocessed for consistent input to the CNN models.
